# Group-Project-One

This notebook pulls from two CSV files that were obtained from Zillow's Housing Data: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/, CSV file "INVENTORY: For-Sale Inventory (Smooth, All Homes, Monthly)" and CSV file "LIST AND SALE PRICES: Median List Price (Smooth, All Homes, Monthly)".

CSV file "INVENTORY: For-Sale Inventory (Smooth, All Homes, Monthly)" provides the count of homes available in each location per month.
CSV file "LIST AND SALE PRICES: Median List Price (Smooth, All Homes, Monthly)" provides the average price of listings in each location per month.

This notebook takes both CSV files and combines them into a single dataset. It then organizes them into an understandable structure, selecting only our top five cities. After selecting the top five cities, it then creates visuals to display the data in two different bar charts.
